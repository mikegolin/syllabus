grade.

Computer Requirements

Students must own or have access to a modern computer that is capable of running
the development tools needed for class. MacBooks are highly recommended, though
most PCs can be made to work as well. Detailed installation instructions for both
platforms will be provided at the first class.

Assignments and Grading

Students must build a project of their choosing throughout the quarter as their final
project. Students are encouraged to work in teams for all assignments including the
final project, but each student must turn in their own project code that they developed
themselves.

- Homework is worth 60% of your grade, based on 3 assignments worth 20% each.
- The Final Project is worth 30% of your grade. Students must deploy a live,
functioning website to a public internet address as their final project.
- Class participation is worth 10% of your grade.
